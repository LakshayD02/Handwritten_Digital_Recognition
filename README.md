# Handwritten_Digital_Recognition

## Description

This project tackles the classic problem of handwritten digit recognition.  It uses a machine learning model  to learn the patterns and features associated with each digit (0-9) from a training dataset .  Once trained, the model can then be used to predict the digit represented in new handwritten input, which could be provided as an image or through other means.  This is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning, with applications in postal code recognition, form processing, and more.

## Features

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loads and preprocesses the training data (e.g., MNIST dataset).  This often involves resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and one-hot encoding labels. 🔢

* **Model Training:** Trains a machine learning model (CNN, SVM, MLP, etc.) on the training data. ⚙️

* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model's performance on a test dataset to assess its accuracy. 📊

* **Prediction:**  Provides functionality to make predictions on new handwritten digit input.  This could involve loading an image, preprocessing it, and then feeding it to the trained model.  🔮

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for machine learning and image processing. 🐍

* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation. 🔢

* **Scikit-learn:**  For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation. ⚙️


## Ideal For

* **Machine Learning Beginners:** A great introductory project to learn about image classification and neural networks. 🧑‍🎓

* **Computer Vision Enthusiasts:**  Exploring basic computer vision techniques. 👀

* **Python Developers:**  Interested in practical applications of machine learning. 👨‍💻👩‍💻
